**How to Get Started**: should give a breakdown of the basic components necessary to start a project using LegoSENSE

**Tutorials**: Provide a basic guideline (a few short articles) on how to do certain steps 
Could also be used to provide more advanced tutorials for advanced users (web dashboard customization)

**Demo Project**: It could be helpful to have the full directions for implementing a simple project to get users with minimal experience started 
E.g. the air quality subway test that was done in the paper can be provided, with setup and results
