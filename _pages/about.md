### Mission Statement 
LegoSENSE aims to make deploying sensor-based systems for a diverse range of IoT applications accessible to more people around the world, including those with strict budgets and minimal programming or embedded systems background.  

### What is LegoSENSE?
LegoSENSE is a modular and flexible platform for rapidly deploying sensing systems in a diverse range of IoT applications and domains, such as digital health, smart homes, and urban safety. LegoSENSE provides an easy-to-use interface for any end user, such as building managers, middle school students, or doctors, regardless of their programming or embedded systems background, thus allowing them to most efficiently deploy sensing systems for their own needs. Additionally, building on top of one of the most well-known single-board computers, Raspberry Pi, LegoSENSE enables simple-to-design add-ons for developers to introduce new sensors into the LegoSENSE ecosystem, all while being low-cost.

### Why LegoSENSE? 
* There is a gap in the market for easily deployable, low-cost, sensing solutions.

* Custom-made industrial sensing solutions are very costly (~$1000s) often lack flexibility and customization in sensor combination for specific use cases. Microprocessor based DIY sensing solutions, on the other hand, require engineering skills and can be time consuming and difficult to effectively implement. LegoSENSE combines the benefits of these two categories of sensing technologies while mitigating their downsides. The specific advantages of LegoSENSE are:

* **Modularity**: LegoSENSE’s modules directly connect sensor(s) to the carrier board with no need to mess with intermediate wiring or peripheral components. Each module includes a non-volatile memory chip factory-programmed with the carrier board’s type, along with any calibration information for the sensor(s). In this way, the carrier board can read from the memory and automatically register and set up the sensor with the Raspberry Pi device to support plug-and-play functionality.
